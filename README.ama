Mango Quality Grading System for Export

AI-Based Ripeness Detection • Size Measurement •weight Measurment (GAP Compliance)
Welcome to the Mango Quality Grading System, a low-cost computer vision and deep learning–based research project designed to automatically grade Alphonso (TJC) mangoes for export quality.
This system replaces subjective human inspection with an objective, repeatable, and consistent AI-driven approach using images captured from a simple setup.
The system evaluates mango quality based on:

✅ Ripeness stage
✅ Physical size 
✅ Weight

The final output clearly decides whether a mango is export quality (GAP compliant) or rejected.

🎯 Research Motivation

Traditional mango grading for export is:
Time-consuming
Subjective (depends on inspector experience)
Inconsistent with strict GAP export standards
This research solves these issues by combining deep learning + computer vision + controlled image acquisition, making mango grading:

✔ Automatic
✔ Objective
✔ Low-cost
✔ Suitable for farmers and exporters in developing countries

⚙️ How It Works — At a Glance
📷 Step 1 — Image Capture (Controlled Setup)

All mango images are captured using a simple image capture box with:
Smartphone camera (fixed height)
White background
Controlled lighting
Fixed mango holder
Ruler / reference object (coin or scale)
✔ Focus is on software intelligence, not hardware complexity
This ensures uniform images for accurate size and shape analysis.

🧠 Step 2 — Ripeness Detection (AI-Based)

A deep learning model is trained using labeled mango images.

The model classifies mangoes into:

Unripe
Semi-ripe
Ripe

Why this matters:
Export mangoes must be at the correct ripeness stage — not underripe or overripe.

📏 Step 3 — Size Measurement (Reference Object Method)

A coin or ruler with known dimensions is placed in the image
OpenCV converts pixel measurements into real-world centimeters
Mango height and width are calculated
These measurements are compared with GAP export size standards.
Because the camera distance is fixed, scale distortion is minimized.
