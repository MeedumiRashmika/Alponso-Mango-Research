🧠 Component 1
🌿 Plant Disease Classification using Xception (TensorFlow)

This project implements a deep learning–based plant disease detection system using the Xception architecture with transfer learning.
It supports image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, evaluation, classification metrics, visualization, and inference.

🥭 Component 2
Mango Quality Grading System for Export

AI-Based Ripeness Detection • Size Measurement • Weight Measurement (GAP Compliance)

Welcome to the Mango Quality Grading System, a low-cost computer vision and deep learning–based research project designed to automatically grade Alphonso (TJC) mangoes for export quality.

This system replaces subjective human inspection with an objective, repeatable, and consistent AI-driven approach using images captured from a simple setup.

Quality Parameters

✅ Ripeness stage
✅ Physical size
✅ Weight

Final output determines whether a mango is export quality (GAP compliant) or rejected.

🎯 Research Motivation

Traditional mango grading for export is:

Time-consuming

Subjective

Inconsistent with GAP standards

This research enables:

✔ Automatic grading
✔ Objective decisions
✔ Low-cost deployment
✔ Suitability for developing countries

⚙️ How It Works

Step 1 — Image Capture

Smartphone camera (fixed height)

White background

Controlled lighting

Fixed mango holder

Reference object (coin/ruler)

Step 2 — Ripeness Detection

Deep learning model

Classes: Unripe / Semi-ripe / Ripe

Step 3 — Size Measurement

Pixel-to-cm conversion using OpenCV

Compared with GAP size standards
