 Smart Export Packaging Recommender System for Alphonso Mangoes  
### Using AI/ML + Deep Learning + Feature Engineering + Flutter + Firebase

This project predicts the best export packaging for Alphonso mangoes in Sri Lanka by using  
**two deep learning models**:

- **Model 1 — Shelf Life Prediction**  
- **Model 2 — Damage % Prediction (Packaging Recommender)**  

The system validates:
- Shelf-life vs. transport duration  
- Legal & eco-friendly packaging rules per country  
- Box layout suitability  
- Number of boxes required  
- Final packaging recommendation  

A **Flutter mobile application** allows farmers/exporters to input shipment details and view results.  
All data is stored in **Firebase Firestore**.

##  Features

### ✔ Model 1 – Shelf Life Prediction (Regression)
Predicts shelf life of Alphonso mangoes using:
- Location  
- Ripeness level  
- Mango size  
- Temperature  
- Humidity  

### ✔ Model 2 – Packaging Damage % Prediction (Regression)
Predicts damage % for different box options based on:
- Box dimensions  
- Number of mangoes  
- Material type  
- Temperature shock  
- Handling quality  
- Density  
- Transport duration  
- Shelf life from Model 1  

### ✔ Additional Pipeline Logic
- Compares **shelf life vs. transport duration** (safe or not safe)
- Legal & eco-friendly packaging validation per country
- Suggests **alternative box** if recommended one is not allowed
- Calculates:
  - Mangoes per box
  - Number of boxes required
