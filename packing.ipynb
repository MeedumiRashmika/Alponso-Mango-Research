However, the `ValueError: Cannot take the length of shape with unknown rank` persists during `model.fit`. This error, originating from `optree.ops.py`, suggests a potential subtle issue with how `tf.constant` creates tensors, particularly for `dtype=tf.string`, which might cause shape metadata to be temporarily 'unknown' during graph construction or internal processing by Keras 3's backend. To address this, I will replace `tf.constant` with `tf.convert_to_tensor` for creating the feature and label tensors for the datasets, as `tf.convert_to_tensor` can sometimes be more robust in ensuring explicit shape definitions when converting from NumPy arrays.\n",

The current `keras.Input(shape=(1,))` combined with `tf.data.Dataset` producing `TensorSpec(shape=(None, 1))` implies each sample is a 1-element vector. However, Keras preprocessing layers often expect scalar inputs per sample, meaning `shape=()` for `keras.Input` and `(None,)` after batching for the `tf.data.Dataset`. I will modify the code to pass 1D arrays (scalar per sample) to `tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices` and update the `keras.Input` layers to `shape=()` to ensure consistent scalar input per sample.\n",

        "## Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Q&A\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. How was the `ValueError: Cannot take the length of shape with unknown rank` during Model 1 training resolved?**\n",
        "The `ValueError` was resolved by ensuring consistency in the shape definitions across the Keras `Input` layers and the preprocessing layers. Initially, there was an attempt to use `keras.Input` layers with `shape=()` (scalar per sample), which conflicted with the `(batch_size, 1)` shape produced by `tf.data.Dataset` and the subsequent processing of features like one-hot encoding. The fix involved reverting `keras.Input` layers to `shape=(1,)` for all features and ensuring that preprocessing layers were adapted using reshaped data (`X_train[col].values.reshape(-1, 1)`), thereby maintaining a consistent rank 2 input `(batch_size, 1)` to the model and preprocessing layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What was the issue encountered when preparing data for Model 2, and how was it fixed?**\n",
        "An initial `KeyError: \"['shipping_conditions'] not in index\"` occurred because the `shipping_conditions` column was mistakenly included in `model2_feature_cols` and `m2_cat_cols` even though it was not present in the `df2` DataFrame. Additionally, the `predicted_shelf_life_days` column was initially overlooked in `m2_num_cols`. The issue was fixed by removing `shipping_conditions` from the feature lists and correctly adding `predicted_shelf_life_days` to `m2_num_cols`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Model 1 `element_spec` Debugging**:\n",
        "    *   The `element_spec` of `train_ds` and `val_ds` correctly showed batched tensors with shapes like `(None, 1)` for individual features and the target, indicating that the `tf.data.Dataset` itself was correctly producing batched data.\n",
        "    *   The persistent `ValueError` during `model1_tf.fit` was due to an inconsistency between the Keras `Input` layer shape expectations and the shapes generated by preprocessing, particularly when `keras.Input` layers were initially set to `shape=()`.\n",
        "    *   After correcting `keras.Input` layers to `shape=(1,)` and ensuring preprocessing layers adapted to `(batch_size, 1)` inputs, Model 1 successfully trained. It achieved a Test Loss (MSE) of 0.5411, Test MAE of 0.5853, and an R² score of 0.9792 on the test set.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Model 2 Data Preparation**:\n",
        "    *   Data preparation for Model 2 encountered an initial `KeyError` due to a non-existent column (`shipping_conditions`) being referenced as a feature.\n",
        "    *   After correcting the feature lists by removing the erroneous column and including `predicted_shelf_life_days` in numerical features, the data was successfully split. The training data had 999 samples (`X2_train` shape: (999, 19), `y2_train` shape: (999,)) and the testing data had 250 samples (`X2_test` shape: (250, 19), `y2_test` shape: (250,)).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Model 2 Architecture**:\n",
        "    *   Model 2 was successfully constructed using the Keras functional API, utilizing `keras.Input` layers for both categorical (`tf.string`, shape `(1,)`) and numerical (`tf.float32`, shape `(1,)`) features.\n",
        "    *   Categorical features underwent `StringLookup` and `CategoryEncoding`, while numerical features were processed with `Normalization`.\n",
        "    *   All preprocessed features were concatenated into a single layer with an output shape of `(None, 66)`.\n",
        "    *   The model comprises three `Dense` layers (64, 64, and 32 units, all with ReLU activation) followed by a 1-unit `Dense` output layer.\n",
        "    *   The compiled model has a total of 10,594 parameters, with 10,561 trainable parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Shape Consistency is Critical**: Emphasize strict consistency in tensor shapes between `tf.data.Dataset` outputs, Keras `Input` layers, and preprocessing layer adaptation to prevent hard-to-debug `ValueError`s related to unknown ranks.\n",
        "*   **Thorough Data Validation**: Prioritize robust data validation steps, especially for column existence and data types, immediately after loading and before model construction to catch `KeyError`s and type mismatches early in the process.\n"
